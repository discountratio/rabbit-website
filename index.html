          Penelope was born in Montreal and grew up in Toronto. At 17, she went
          to Korea to live with her grandmother for three years, where she
          learned how to make art with porcelain. Upon returning to Canada and
          graduating high school, she pursued a career in art.

          She started out as a graphic designer, but soon found that she had an
          affinity for ceramic sculpture. She decided to pursue ceramics as a
          full-time career and enrolled at Sheridan College's School of Art &
          Design in Oakville, Ontario. After graduating with a Bachelor of Fine
          Arts degree (BFA), Penelope relocated back to Montreal where she
          currently lives with her husband, who works as an architect.
